# E-Commerce Dataset Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes an **e-commerce dataset** to gain insights into sales trends, product performance, and customer behavior. The dataset includes information on transactions such as product details, quantity sold, unit price, and the country where the sale occurred.

The analysis includes:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, formatting dates, and preparing data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing sales patterns, country distributions, and product performance.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Tracking sales trends over time.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identifying relationships between numerical variables like quantity sold and unit price.

## Dataset Information

The dataset contains the following columns:

- `InvoiceNo`: Unique identifier for each transaction.
- `StockCode`: Unique code for each product.
- `Description`: Description of the product.
- `Quantity`: Number of products sold per transaction.
- `InvoiceDate`: Date and time of the transaction.
- `UnitPrice`: Price per unit of the product.
- `CustomerID`: Unique identifier for each customer.
- `Country`: The country where the customer resides.

### Data Source
The data is a sample from a **fictional e-commerce company** for analysis purposes. It contains transaction details for **online retail** sales over a specific period.

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce-data-analysis.git
   cd ecommerce-data-analysis
   ```

2. **Install required dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python installed, then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebooks**:
   Open the Jupyter Notebooks to explore the analysis:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Key Files

- **`data_cleaning.ipynb`**: Handles missing values, converts date columns, and prepares data for analysis.
- **`exploratory_analysis.ipynb`**: Provides visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots to understand sales patterns.
- **`time_series_analysis.ipynb`**: Analyzes trends over time, exploring sales dynamics by month, week, or day.

## Analysis Summary

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Sales by Country**: Visualization of sales distribution across countries.
- **Top Products**: Identifies the most sold products based on quantity.
- **Sales Over Time**: Time series analysis of total sales across different periods.

### Correlation Analysis

- **Quantity vs Unit Price**: Examines the correlation between the number of items sold and their price.

## Usage

- **Modify and Extend**: The notebooks are structured for easy modification. You can add more analysis or change visualizations as per your needs.
- **Custom Analysis**: If you have specific analysis in mind, adapt the existing notebooks or scripts.
